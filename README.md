# TLMC_SCRIPTS

### Touhou Lossless Music Collection Scripts

These are some scripts I use to download some of my favorite music from the **Touhou Lossless Music Collection.**

---
### Usage
Make sure the TLMC FTP link is active before running.

At the time of scripting, the url is
`http://151.80.40.155/tlmc/`

1. Run `TLMC.py` to obtain a `TLMC.json` file. This file contains all the links to the music files along with the directory structure. (My file is already included in the repo as TLMC.sample.json, to use it, rename it to TLMC.json. However, it is recommended to generate your own file. Just because it is fun.)

2. Run `makedir.py` to create the directory structure in your Local file system.

3. Run `DIR_Downloader.py` to download the music files. Make sure you to put in the required directory in BASEPATH variable. Add extra `\` in windows.

### While music is preparing, please wait warmly and have some tea.

CoverArt fetcher will be completed later. It has the mutagen dependency.

### Disclaimer
This project is meant for educational purposes only. I do not own any of the music files. All the music files are owned by their respective owners. Please support the original artists by buying their music or streaming it on Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube on their official channels or any other streaming service.

Do not attempt to overload or DDoS the TLMC FTP server. It is a community effort to share music. If you want to contribute, please contact the TLMC team.

Script not made with any user friendlyness in mind. I made it for myself. If you want to use it, you are free to do so. If you want to contribute, please do so.
